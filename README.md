# CIFAR10 image classification 

This project was completed while studying Master's in Data Science at Glasgow Caledonia University. The aim of the project was to compare the performance of two convolutional neural network (CNN) models at image classification. Transfer learning was used to speed up the training process. The two CNN models used are VGG16 and ResNet50.
