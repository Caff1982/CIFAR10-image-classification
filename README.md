# CNN model comparison on CIFAR10 dataset using transfer learning

The aim of this project was to compare the performance of two convolutional neural network (CNN) models at image classification. Transfer learning was used to speed up the training process. The two CNN models used are VGG16 and ResNet50.

## Environment

- Python 3.6
- TensorFlow 2.6
- Jupyter Notebook

## CIFAR10 dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The ten different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.
